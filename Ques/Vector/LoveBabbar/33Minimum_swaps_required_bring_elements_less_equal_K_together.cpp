// A simple solution is to first count all elements less than or equal to k(say ‘good’). 
// Now traverse for every sub-array and swap those elements whose value is greater than k. 
// The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2)


// An efficient approach is to use the two-pointer technique and a sliding window. 
// The time complexity of this approach is O(n)
